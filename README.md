# NO LONGER DEVELOPED

Thanks for your interest but given the fact that Google has released (at last) a [Tasks app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tasks), I've decided to not pursue my effort to make this app work.

As a possible replacement, see also https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android 

The source will be left available here in case it is useful to anyone but it is extremely unlikely to receive further official updates.
